# Visualizing-Data

Create by: Helen Yu

This practice is a glance for the matplotlib library with Python, using simply generated data and create several proper visualizations.

## A simple lie in storytelling
Even with the same dataset, a different scale would result in a totally different visualization that may mislead audiences.
Here is a comparison:

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Here is a study of tradeoff between bias and variance in terms of model complexity, where we can see that models may go under-fitting if the model is too easy and become overfitting if the model is too complex.

## How a label works

Here is a comparison between visualizations with and without labels. The one with labels is much clearer.
